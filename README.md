# Configure

## Keys

You may redefine the key bindings in your sublime-keymap with command `toggle_word`.


## User defined arrays

You can define lists of words, which will be cycled through in order.

Example file `ToggleWords.sublime-settings`:

```
{
    // User defined words
    "toggle_words_dict": [
        ["left", "right"],
        ["up", "down"],
        ["top", "bottom"],
        ["width", "height"],
        ["red","orange","yellow","green","blue","purple"],
        ["true", "false"],
        ["yes", "no"],
        ["on", "off"],
        ["0", "1"]
    ]
}
```

If installed using `Package Control` dictionary file should be located in `<data_path>/Packages`. To get there select `Preferences -> Browse Packages...` in Sublime menu. Create one if it does not exist.
